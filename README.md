# SSH-Honeypot-with-Custom-Logging
Deployed a low-interaction Cowrie SSH honeypot on a Linux VM to capture attacker behavior, login attempts, and downloaded payloads. Includes a Python script that parses JSON logs and generates a summary of top attacking IPs, most common commands, and downloaded files for easy reporting.
